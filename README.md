The following configurations: 
- Players may configure between 6-8 colors to choose from. 
- A player may choose to play against a computer.
- A player may choose the available number of holes to insert the colored objects between 4-5

Unchangeable rules:
- Only 10 retries for each codebreaker
- There is only 4 available feedback holes given to the codebreaker.

For feedback holes:
White represents a correctly guessed color, but not in the correct hole.
Pink represents a correctly guessed color slotted on the correct hole.

Note: Feedback holes are not associated with any holes in which a colored object is slotted. They merely represent a seat for available feedback given to the user, which means that they are not ordered based on the order of the inserted colored objects.
